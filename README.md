##  _DCGANs are a type of neural network used in machine learning to generate new, authentic-looking data. They consist of two main parts: the generator and the discriminator. The generator tries to create new data (e.g., images), while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generator._

## Definition


- Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) are a type of generative neural network architecture that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to create realistic synthetic images. DCGANs consist of two competing neural network models: the generator, which creates images, and the discriminator, which tries to distinguish between real images and images generated by the generator. Through this adversarial learning process, DCGANs can generate new images that are highly similar to real images.
